# Signify

## Description
Signify is a project designed to recognize and interpret American Sign Language (ASL) using machine learning techniques. The goal is to create an application that can help bridge communication gaps for the hearing impaired by translating sign language into text or speech.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the [American Sign Language dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapillondhe/american-sign-language/data) from Kaggle. This dataset contains images of various ASL signs, which are used to train the model for sign recognition.

## Installation Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd signify
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the application, use the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
You can interact with the application through the user interface, which allows you to upload images or use a webcam to capture signs.
